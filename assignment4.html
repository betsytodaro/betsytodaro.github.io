            <h1>Assignment 4: High(er) voltage and transistors</h1>

            <p>Here is the LED strip changing brightness using analogWrite and a transistor to control the higher voltage!</p>    
            <h2>Circuit</h2>
            <img src="a4circuit.jpg" width=600></a>
            <p>Here is the circuit including an NPN transistor and about 1/3 of an LED light strip. I used alligator clips to connect the lights to the 12V power supply and to the left-most pin on the transistor (if the flat side is facing away). Then, the negative end of the power supply is attached to ground. The transistor is connected to pin 9, ground, and the LED strip. </p>
            <h2>Schematic</h2>
            <img src="a4schematic.jpg" width=400></a>
            <p> The schematic shows the connection between the 12V power supply to the LED strip and the power supply to ground. The other side of the LED strip is then connected to the 3rd pin of the transistor which is also connected to pin 9 (middle) and ground. The transistor controls the higher voltage of the power supply. <br>
            I used about 30 LEDs from the strip which translates to about 1.8 watts (300LEDS/18W = 30LEDS/xW). Using P=IV, 1.8W = I(12V), I = .15A. The transistor can handle up to .6A, so my circuit is safe. 
            <h2>Code</h2>
            <img src="a4code.jpg" width=600></a>
            <p>The code for this circuit changes the voltage sent to the LED strip by using analogWrite in the void loop. The incrementing brightness is controlled by pin 9 which is sent through the transistor to the LED strip. See comments on each line of code for more info! </p>
