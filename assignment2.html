            <p>Here is the LED fading in using the button!</p>    
            <h2>Circuit</h2>

            <p>Here is the circuit including a button and an LED. I connected one leg of the button to 5V, one leg to ground using a 1k resistor, and one leg on the other side connected to pin 2. I then connected an LED like in the previous assignment to pin 6 (used a 1k resistor). I chose to use 1k resistors to be safe, although the blue LED would only require a 100 ohm resistor. The button is not directly connected to the LED, but can control the LED within the code. </p>

            <p>Here is a schematic showing the button and LEDs connection to ground, power, and their resistors.
            <h2>Code</h2>
            <img src="A2Code.jpg" width=600></a>
            <p>The code for this circuit allows the button on pin 2 to control the LED on pin 6. When the button is pressed, AnalogWrite increments the LED's brightness within a for loop. See code comments for more info!
