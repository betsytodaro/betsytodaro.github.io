            Circuit for 3 blinking LEDs. I used pins 11, 12, and 13 for power and connected ground to the negative row on the breadboard. I connected to power for each LED with a red wire connected to a resistor first (330 ohms for red, 100 ohms for blue, and 100 ohms for green), then the resistor to the corresponding LED. I calculated the resistance needed for each LED using the equation V=IxR. Finally, I connected black wires from the negative row on the bread board (ground) to the second pin on each LED.

        	<p>
        		Here is the schematic for each of the LEDs and the calculation for the resistors with 5V of power from the board. I used the target of 20mA and the drop voltage for each light.

		Here is the code I used within the Arduino IDE to create the sequence of LED blinks. See comments in the code for a description of each section of code. </p> <br>
