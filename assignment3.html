            <p>Here is the circuit including an LDR (light dependent resistor) and an LED. I connected one leg of the LDR to 5V, one leg to ground and A0 using a 1k resistor (A0 is the input pin). I then connected an LED like in the previous assignment to pin 9 (used a 1k resistor) and the other leg to ground. I chose to use a 1k resistor to be safe, although the red LED would only require a 220 ohm resistor. The LDR will control the brightness of the LED with code. </p>

            <p>Here is a schematic showing the button and LEDs connection to ground, power, and their resistors.
            <h2>Code</h2>
            <img src="A3code.jpg" width=600></a>
            <p>The code for this circuit allows the LDR on pin A0 to control the LED on pin 9. When the light sensor senses a very high amount of light, the LED is turned off using analogWrite. When the light is not very high, the LED mirrors the brightness value sensed by the LDR. </p>
