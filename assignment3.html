            <p>Here is the LED changing brightness along with the brightness change for the sensor! When the LDR senses a lot of light (gif 2), the light turns off completely!</p>

            <p>Here is the circuit including an LDR (light dependent resistor) and an LED. I connected one leg of the LDR to 5V, one leg to ground and A0 using a 1k resistor (A0 is the input pin). I then connected an LED like in the previous assignment to pin 9 (used a 1k resistor) and the other leg to ground. I chose to use a 1k resistor to be safe, although the red LED would only require a 220 ohm resistor. The LDR will control the brightness of the LED with code. </p>
            <h2>Schematic</h2>

            <p>Here is a schematic showing the LDR connected to 5V and ground with a 1k resistor and the other leg to pin A0. I chose a 1k resistor because the data sheet showed the range of resistance can go up to 11k. I'm not using lights bright enough to reach that high, but I probably should've used a 10k resistor to be safe. The red lED is connected to pin 9 
            (PWM so it can vary in brightness) through a 1k resistor (voltage drop = 1.8V; V = IR; 5v-1.8V = 20mA x R; 3.2V/.02A = 160 ohms; used 1k to be safe) and the other leg to ground.
            <h2>Code</h2>
            <img src="A3code.jpg" width=600></a>
            <p>The code for this circuit allows the LDR on pin A0 to control the LED on pin 9. When the light sensor senses a very high amount of light, the LED is turned off using analogWrite. When the light is not very high, the LED mirrors the brightness value sensed by the LDR. </p>
